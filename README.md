# STM32 Chrome Dino Game

A Chrome dinosaur-inspired running game implementation for STM32F1 microcontrollers with LCD display.

## Features

- 🦖 Animated running dinosaur with jump mechanics
- 🌵 Randomly generated cactus obstacles
- 📊 Score tracking with automatic difficulty increase
- 🎮 Simple one-button control
- 💥 Collision detection and game over state

## Hardware Requirements

- STM32F1xx microcontroller (e.g., STM32F103)
- LCD display (ST7920 or compatible)
- Push button for jump control
- Basic power supply and connections

## Controls

- **Button Press**: Make the dino jump
- **After Game Over**: Press button to restart

## Game Mechanics

- Press the button to jump over cactus
- Score increases as you survive longer
- Game speed increases with higher scores
- Collision ends the game
- Multiple obstacle types (big/small cactus)

## Build & Flash

This project is designed for STM32 development environments (STM32CubeIDE, Keil, etc.). Configure your toolchain for STM32F1xx and flash to your board.

## Customization

- Modify `BUTTON_PIN` and `BUTTON_PORT` for your button configuration
- Adjust `MAX_OBSTACLES` for difficulty
- Change `OBSTACLE_SPEED` for game speed (lower = faster)
- Adjust `JUMP_HANG_TIME` for jump duration
